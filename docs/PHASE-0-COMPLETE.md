## Completed Tasks

### 1. Cost Validation Test Infrastructure ✅

**What We Built**:
- Automated test script with 3 complexity scenarios
- Token usage measurement and cost calculation
- Monthly cost projections
- JSON report generation
- Comparison with PRD estimates

**Files Created**:
- `tests/cost-validation/test-generation-cost.js` (383 lines)
- `tests/cost-validation/README.md`
- `.env.example`
- `.gitignore`

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready to run (requires API key)

**How to Run**:
```bash
# 1. Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Run test
npm run test:cost
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Validates costs are ≤ $0.20 per worksheet
- Provides monthly projections
- Saves detailed cost report JSON

- Performance measurement

**Files Created**:
- `tests/pdf-poc/generate-sample-worksheet.js` (290 lines)
- `tests/pdf-poc/output/sample-worksheet.pdf` ✅
- `tests/pdf-poc/output/sample-answer-key.pdf` ✅

**Test Results**:
```
Worksheet Generation:
  ✅ Time: 0.03s (target: <5s)
  ✅ Size: 4.20 KB (target: <2MB)

### 3. Architecture Decisions Documented ✅

**ADR-001: PDF Generation Approach**
- **Decision**: Node.js + PDFKit (Option B)
- **Rationale**: Simpler, faster, same ecosystem as Next.js
- **Alternative**: Python + ReportLab (rejected due to complexity)
- **File**: `docs/architecture/ADR-001-pdf-generation.md`

**ADR-002: Visual Assets Strategy**
- **Decision**: Pre-made SVG assets (Option A)
- **Rationale**: Zero cost, instant, reliable
- **Alternative**: AI-generated images (rejected due to $80-120/month cost)
- **Implementation Plan**: Download 60 SVGs (12 per theme)
- **File**: `docs/architecture/ADR-002-visual-assets-strategy.md`

---

### 4. Project Documentation ✅

**Files Created**:
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `docs/PHASE-0-SUMMARY.md` - Phase 0 progress tracking
- `docs/PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md` - This file (completion report)
- `package.json` - Project configuration with test scripts

**Documentation Quality**:
- ✅ Clear instructions for running tests
- ✅ Architecture decisions explained
- ✅ Next steps documented
- ✅ Success criteria defined

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Phase 1)

1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Run Cost Validation Test**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   npm run test:cost
   ```

2. **Review cost report** (`tests/cost-validation/cost-report-*.json`)

3. **Make decision**:
   - ✅ If costs ≤ $0.20: Proceed to Phase 1
   - ⚠️ If costs > $0.20: Optimize or adjust pricing

### Phase 1 Preview (Days 1-2)

Once Phase 0 is complete, begin Phase 1:

```bash
# Day 1-2 Tasks:
1. Initialize Next.js project
2. Set up Supabase
3. Configure database schema (Prisma)
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Create environment configuration

# Estimated Time: 2 days
```

See [IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md#days-1-2-project-infrastructure) for detailed tasks.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. PDFKit is faster than expected (0.03s vs 5s target)
2. Documentation-first approach clarified decisions
3. Proof-of-concept validated assumptions early
4. ADRs captured rationale for future reference

### What Could Be Improved ⚠️
1. Cost test requires manual API key setup (expected)
2. SVG asset curation deferred (acceptable for now)
3. Need to validate PDFs in all browsers (manual step)

### Recommendations for Phase 1 📝
1. Keep documentation-first approach
2. Run tests early and often
3. Deploy to production early (Day 2)
4. Test with real users quickly (beta in Phase 3)
