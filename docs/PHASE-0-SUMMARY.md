# Phase 0: Pre-Development Summary

**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-29
**Goal**: Validate assumptions and finalize architecture decisions before full implementation

---

## Overview

Phase 0 is a critical validation phase to de-risk the project by:
1. Validating actual API costs vs estimates
2. Deciding on visual assets strategy
3. Finalizing PDF generation architecture

---

## Task 1: Cost Validation Test ✅

### Status: READY TO RUN

### What We Built
- ✅ Cost validation test script with 3 scenarios
- ✅ Test infrastructure (tests/cost-validation/)
- ✅ Automated cost calculation and projections
- ✅ JSON report generation

### Test Scenarios
1. **Easy**: Grade 1 Addition (10 problems, Animals theme)
2. **Medium**: Grade 3 Multiplication (12 problems, Space theme)
3. **Hard**: Grade 6 Fractions (15 problems, Nature theme)

### How to Run

```bash
# 1. Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Run the test
npm run test:cost
```

### What Gets Measured
- Input/output token usage per worksheet
- Cost breakdown (input vs output)
- Average cost per worksheet
- Monthly projections (100, 500, 1000, 5000 generations)
- Comparison with PRD estimates ($0.05-$0.15)

### Expected Results
- **PRD Estimate**: $0.05 - $0.15 per worksheet
- **Target**: Stay within or below this range
- **Decision Point**: If costs exceed $0.20, consider optimization strategies

### Next Steps After Running
1. Review the generated cost report JSON
2. Compare actual vs estimated costs
3. Document findings below
4. Make go/no-go decision

## Task 2: Visual Assets Strategy

### Status: NOT STARTED

### Options to Evaluate

#### Option A: Pre-Made SVG Assets (Recommended for MVP)
**Pros:**
- Zero cost per generation
- Fast (instant)
- Reliable and consistent quality
- Full control over design

**Cons:**
- Upfront work to create/source assets
- Limited variety (but sufficient for MVP)

**Estimated Effort:**
- Research: 1 hour
- Source/create 50 SVG assets: 3-4 hours
- Create manifest: 30 minutes
- **Total: ~5 hours**

**Cost:** $0/generation

#### Option B: AI-Generated Images (DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion)
**Pros:**
- Unlimited variety
- Highly relevant to problems
- Novel and engaging

**Cons:**
- $0.04-$0.08 per worksheet (DALL-E 3)
- 2-3 seconds generation time per image
- Quality not guaranteed
- More complex implementation

**Cost:** ~$0.06/generation + Claude API

### Recommended Decision: Option A for MVP

**Rationale:**
- Cost-effective (zero per generation)
- Faster implementation
- More reliable for launch
- Can add AI images post-MVP

### SVG Asset Sources
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) - Free, customizable illustrations
- [Storyset](https://storyset.com/) - Free animated illustrations
- [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.com/) - Free vector illustrations
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/illustrations) - Free/paid illustrations

### Theme Categories (5 themes, 10 SVGs each)
1. **Animals**: Farm animals, pets, zoo animals, sea creatures
2. **Space**: Planets, rockets, stars, astronauts
3. **Sports**: Soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming
4. **Food**: Fruits, vegetables, snacks, meals
5. **Nature**: Trees, flowers, mountains, weather

## Task 3: PDF Generation Architecture

### Status: NOT STARTED

### Options to Evaluate

#### Option A: Python FastAPI + ReportLab
**Pros:**
- ReportLab is mature and powerful
- Great PDF layout control
- Can deploy as Vercel serverless function

**Cons:**
- Separate service to maintain
- Python in Node.js ecosystem
- Cold start latency

**Estimated Generation Time:** 2-3 seconds

#### Option B: Node.js + PDFKit
**Pros:**
- Pure JavaScript (same ecosystem)
- Simpler deployment
- Faster cold starts
- Easier to maintain

**Cons:**
- PDFKit less powerful than ReportLab
- More manual layout work

**Estimated Generation Time:** 1-2 seconds

### Recommended Decision: Option B (Node.js + PDFKit)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler architecture (one language)
- Faster for MVP implementation
- Adequate for MVP needs
- Can switch to ReportLab later if needed

### Proof of Concept Tasks
1. Install PDFKit: `npm install pdfkit`
2. Create simple worksheet PDF with:
   - Header with title
   - 10 math problems
   - Footer with page number
3. Create answer key PDF
4. Measure generation time
5. Verify PDF opens in browsers

## Decision Summary

### Cost Validation
**Status**: ⏳ Awaiting test results

**Go Criteria:**
- Average cost ≤ $0.20/worksheet
- All 3 scenarios succeed
- Response quality acceptable

### Visual Assets
**Decision**: ✅ Pre-made SVG assets (Option A)

**Next Steps:**
- Source 50 SVG assets (5 themes × 10 assets)
- Create asset manifest JSON
- Organize in `public/assets/svg/`

### PDF Generation
**Decision**: ✅ Node.js + PDFKit (Option B)

**Next Steps:**
- Create proof-of-concept
- Test PDF generation
- Measure performance
