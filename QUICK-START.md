# Quick Start Guide

## Phase 0 Status: ‚úÖ Setup Complete

Phase 0 implementation is done! Here's what to do next.

---

## Step 1: Run Cost Validation Test ‚è≥

This test validates that Claude API costs are within budget.

### Prerequisites
1. Get Anthropic API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Have ~$0.50 in API credits (test costs ~$0.30-0.45)

### Run the Test

```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Run cost validation test
npm run test:cost
```

### What Happens
The test will:
- Generate 3 sample worksheets (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Measure token usage and costs
- Calculate monthly projections
- Save detailed report to `tests/cost-validation/cost-report-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Expected Output
```
üìä COST ANALYSIS & PROJECTIONS
================================
Average Per Worksheet:
   Cost:           $0.XXXX per worksheet
   Input Tokens:   ~1,500 tokens
   Output Tokens:  ~2,000 tokens

Monthly Cost Projections:
    100 generations/month: $XX.XX
    500 generations/month: $XX.XX
   1000 generations/month: $XX.XX
```

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Average cost ‚â§ $0.20 per worksheet
- ‚úÖ All 3 scenarios succeed
- ‚úÖ Response validation passes

### If Costs Are Too High
See optimization strategies in [docs/PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md](docs/PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md#cost-optimization)

---

## Step 2: Verify PDF Generation ‚è≥

PDFs have been generated. Verify they look good.

### Open Sample PDFs

```bash
# Generate fresh samples (optional)
npm run test:pdf

# Then open these files:
# - tests/pdf-poc/output/sample-worksheet.pdf
# - tests/pdf-poc/output/sample-answer-key.pdf
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Open in Chrome - does it look good?
- [ ] Open in Firefox - does it look good?
- [ ] Open in Safari (if on Mac) - does it look good?
- [ ] Try printing - does it print correctly?
- [ ] Check formatting - proper spacing, readable text?

---

## Step 3: Make Go/No-Go Decision ‚è≥

Based on cost test results:

### ‚úÖ GO (Costs ‚â§ $0.20/worksheet)
Proceed to Phase 1:
```bash
# Mark Phase 0 complete in IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md
# Begin Days 1-2: Project Infrastructure
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIMIZE (Costs $0.20-0.30/worksheet)
Consider optimizations:
- Reduce prompt length
- Use prompt caching
- Limit visual aid descriptions
- Adjust problem counts

Then re-run test and decide.

### ‚ùå NO-GO (Costs >$0.30/worksheet)
- Review pricing model
- Consider alternative AI models
- Consult team on budget

## Step 4: (Optional) Download Visual Assets

Can be done now or during Days 1-2.

### Asset Sources
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) - Search for: animals, space, sports, food, nature
- [Storyset](https://storyset.com/) - Filter by style: "flat illustration"
- [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.com/) - Browse free illustrations

### Download Plan
- **Animals**: 12 SVGs (cow, dog, cat, fish, etc.)
- **Space**: 12 SVGs (rocket, planet, star, alien, etc.)
- **Sports**: 12 SVGs (ball, player, equipment, etc.)
- **Food**: 12 SVGs (apple, pizza, carrot, etc.)
- **Nature**: 12 SVGs (tree, flower, sun, mountain, etc.)

### Organize Files
```bash
mkdir -p public/assets/svg/{animals,space,sports,food,nature}

# Save files as:
# public/assets/svg/animals/cow.svg
# public/assets/svg/space/rocket.svg
# etc.
```

See [ADR-002](docs/architecture/ADR-002-visual-assets-strategy.md) for details.

## Step 5: Begin Phase 1 (Days 1-2)

Once Steps 1-3 are complete, start Phase 1.

### Phase 1 Overview
**Goal**: Deployable skeleton with core dependencies
**Duration**: 2 days
**Tasks**: 47 tasks

### First Commands

```bash
# Initialize Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest math-worksheet-generator

# Choose options:
# ‚úÖ TypeScript
# ‚úÖ ESLint
# ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS
# ‚úÖ App Router
# ‚úÖ Default import alias (@/*)

cd math-worksheet-generator

# Install additional dependencies
npm install @supabase/supabase-js prisma @prisma/client

# Continue with Days 1-2 tasks...
```

See [IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md](IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md#days-1-2-project-infrastructure) for full task list.
